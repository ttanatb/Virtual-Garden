		<h3>How the project was created</h3>
		<p>I used canvas to create this project. Everything is written in JavaScript. The perlin noise functions that
		are used are from <a href="https://github.com/josephg/noisejs">this reposity</a>.
		<h3>What new skills you had to realize the project</h3>
		<p>I learned a lot about the dynamics of JavaScript. It took me a while to really understand how object variables are
		different from object parameters. I got to polish a lot about math and trigonometry by calculating how to draw bezier curves
		that resemble stretching balls. I also learned quite a bit about quadratic curves as the grass are all randomly generated
		based on a structure that's defined by quadratic curves. I also learned about canvas and how to use it in general. Using the
		perlin functions also helped me understand more about utilizing public resources. I also learned how simulate physics with
		the least amount of variables possible (just position and velocity) such that all the objects on screen can update without lag.
		<h3>Areas you see for future improvement</h3>
		<p>There could be more stuff on the screen, more interactions between the objects and more ways in which players
		can interact with the object on screen. I wanted create something pretty with just black and white and I think it
		came out pretty fine.
